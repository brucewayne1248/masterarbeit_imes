  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we describe the state of the art in continuum robot manipulators and systems intended for application to interventional medicine. Inspired by biological trunks, tentacles, and snakes, continuum robot designs can traverse confined spaces, manipulate objects in complex environments, and conform to curvilinear paths in space. In addition, many designs offer inherent structural compliance and ease of miniaturization. After decades of pioneering research, a host of designs have now been investigated and have demonstrated capabilities beyond the scope of conventional rigid-link robots. Recently, we have seen increasing efforts aimed at leveraging these qualities to improve the frontiers of minimally invasive surgical interventions. Several concepts have now been commercialized, which are inspiring and enabling a current paradigm shift in surgical approaches toward flexible access routes, e.g., through natural orifices such as the nose. In this paper, we provide an overview of the current state of this field from the perspectives of both robotics science and medical applications.We discuss relevant research in design, modeling, control, and sensing for continuum manipulators, and we highlight how this work is being used to build robotic systems for specific surgical procedures. We provide perspective for the future by discussing current limitations, open questions, and challenges.},

  Abstract                 = {Hyper-redundant (or snakelike) manipulators have many more degrees of freedom than required to position and orient an object in space. They have been employed in a variety of applications ranging from search-and-rescue to minimally invasive surgical procedures, and recently they even have been proposed as solutions to problems in maintaining civil infrastructure and the repair of satellites. The kinematic and dynamic properties of snakelike robots are captured naturally using a continuum backbone curve equipped with a naturally evolving set of reference frames, stiffness properties, and mass density. When the snakelike robot has a continuum architecture, the backbone curve corresponds with the physical device itself. Interestingly, these same modeling ideas can be used to describe conformational shapes of DNA molecules and filamentous protein structures in solution and in cells. This paper reviews several classes of snakelike robots: (1) hyper-redundant manipulators guided by backbone curves; (2) flexible steerable needles; and (3) concentric tube continuum robots. It is then shown how the same mathematical modeling methods used in these robotics contexts can be used to model molecules such as DNA. All of these problems are treated in the context of a common mathematical framework based on the differential geometry of curves, continuum mechanics, and variational calculus. Both coordinate-dependent Euler-Lagrange formulations and coordinate-free Euler-Poincar{\'{e}} approaches are reviewed.},

  Abstract                 = {The usefulness and versatility of a robotic end-effector depends on the diversity of grasps it can accomplish and also on the complexity of the control methods required to achieve them. We believe that soft hands are able to provide diverse and robust grasping with low control complexity. They possess many mechanical degrees of freedom and are able to implement complex deformations. At the same time, due to the inherent compliance of soft materials, only very few of these mechani-cal degrees have to be controlled explicitly. Soft hands therefore may combine the best of both worlds. In this paper, we present RBO Hand 2, a highly compliant, underactuated, robust, and dexterous anthropomorphic hand. The hand is inex-pensive to manufacture and the morphology can easily be adapted to specific applications. To enable efficient hand design, we derive and evaluate computational models for the mechanical properties of the hand's basic building blocks, called PneuFlex actuators. The versatility of RBO Hand 2 is evaluated by implementing the comprehensive Feix taxonomy of human grasps. The manipulator's capabilities and limits are demonstrated using the Kapandji test and grasping experi-ments with a variety of objects of varying weight. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the effective dimensionality of grasp postures exceeds the dimensionality of the actuation signals, illustrating that complex grasping behavior can be achieved with relatively simple control.},

  Abstract                 = {Seven years ago, concentric tube robots were essentially unknown in robotics, yet today one would be hard pressed to find a major medical robotics forum that does not include several presentations on them. Indeed, we now stand at a noteworthy moment in the history of these robots. The recent maturation of foundational models has created new opportunities for research in control, sensing, planning, design, and applications, which are attracting an increasing number of robotics researchers with diverse interests. The purpose of this review is to facilitate the continued growth of the subfield by describing the state of the art in concentric tube robot research. We begin with current and proposed applications for these robots and then trace their origins (some aspects of which date back to 1985), before proceeding to describe the state of the art in terms of modeling, control, sensing, and design. The paper concludes with forward-looking perspectives, noting that concentric tube robots provide rich opportunities for further research, yet simultaneously appear poised to become viable commercial devices in the near future.},

This novel approach, which carefully considers physical manipulator constraints, avoids artifacts of simplifying assumptions associated with previous approaches, such as the need to fit the resulting solutions to the physical robot. It is applicable to a wide class of existing continuum robots and models extension, as well as bending, of individual sections. In addition, this approach produces correct results for orientation, in contrast to some previously published approaches.

  Abstract                 = {Tendon-driven continuum robots offer increased dexterity and manipulability in comparison to conventional rigid link serial manipulators. Being able to conform to complex curves in 3D space, continuum robots are in particular useful for applications in restricted and hardly accessible environments. The workspace of a tendon-driven continuum robot depends on the number of sections, as well as the length of each section and its range of bending radii. Common tendon-driven robot designs have fixed section lengths such that deployment along a tortuous paths requires additional linear translation of the whole robot. In this paper, we propose a novel tendon-driven continuum robot with extensible sections. A telescoping backbone allows control of the section length during operation in addition to bending through tendon actuation. Thus, the arc length of a section can vary and the range of bending radii is enlarged. As a result, the novel robot design inherently allows for deployment along tortuous paths in a follow-the-leader fashion. We suggest the use of spacer disks equipped with permanent magnets with alternating pole orientation.

This task comprises substantial challenges including high dimensionality, restrictive and unknown actuation ranges, and nonstationary system behavior. We use a recent exploration scheme, online goal babbling, which deals with these challenges by bootstrapping and adapting the inverse kinematics on the fly. We show the success of the method in extensive real-world experiments on the nonstationary robot, including a novel combination of learning and traditional feedback control. Simulations further investigate the impact of nonstationary actuation ranges, drifting sensors, and morphological changes. The experiments provide the first substantial quantitative real-world evidence for the success of goal-directed bootstrapping schemes, moreover with the challenge of nonstationary system behavior. We thereby provide the first functioning control concept for this challenging robot platform.},

  Abstract                 = {Tendons are a widely used actuation strategy for continuum robots that enable forces and moments to be transmitted along the robot from base-mounted actuators. Most prior robots have used tendons routed in straight paths along the robot. However, routing tendons through general curved paths within the robot offers potential advantages in reshaping the workspace and enabling a single section of the robot to achieve a wider variety of desired shapes. In this paper, we provide a new model for the statics and dynamics of robots with general tendon routing paths that is derived by coupling the classical Cosserat-rod and Cosserat-string models. This model also accounts for general external loading conditions and includes traditional axially routed tendons as a special case. The advantage of the usage of this coupled model for straight-tendon robots is that it accounts for the distributed wrenches that tendons apply along the robot. We show that these are necessary to consider when the robot is subjected to out-of-plane external loads. Our experimental results demonstrate that the coupled model matches experimental tip positions with an error of 1.7{\%} of the robot length, in a set of experiments that include both straight and nonstraight routing cases, with both point and distributed external loads.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents the clinical motivation, design specifications, kinematics, statics, and actuation compensation for a newly constructed telerobotic system for Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) of the throat. A hybrid dual-arm telesurgical slave, with twenty joint-space Degrees of Freedom (DoF), is used in this telerobotic system to provide the necessary dexterity in deep surgical fields such as the throat. The telerobotic slave uses novel continuum robots that use multiple super-elastic backbones for actuation and structural integrity. The paper presents the kinematics of the telesurgical slave and methods for actuation compensation to cancel the effects of backlash, friction, and flexibility of the actuation lines. A method for actuation compensation is presented in order to overcome uncertainties of modeling, friction, and backlash. This method uses a tiered hierarchy of two novel approaches of actuation compensation for remotely actuated snake-like robots. The tiered approach for actuation compensation uses compensation in both joint space and configuration space of the continuum robots. These actuation hybrid compensation schemes use intrinsic model information and external data through a recursive linear estimation algorithm and involve compensation using configuration space and joint space variables. Experimental results validate the ability of our integrated telemanipulation system through experiments of suturing and knot tying in confined spaces.},

However, the lack of enough stiffness limits their scope and application. In this paper, we introduce four different structures of continuum manipulators, including a simple structure with three elastic actuated rods, a structure with a passive rigid kinematic chain, a structure with a hyperelastic notochord and a segmental structure inspired from the spine without articular structure. This paper presents an experimental comparison of four continuum manipulators and aims to explore approaches to enhance the stiffness of a continuum manipulator and maintain the simple constant curvature kinematics as far as possible simultaneously. Results of this paper contribute to guiding the design of a continuum manipulator for achieving desired stiffness properties.},

  Abstract                 = {Continuum robotics has rapidly become a rich and diverse area of research, with many designs and applications demonstrated. Despite this diversity in form and purpose, there exists remarkable similarity in the fundamental simplified kinematic models that have been applied to continuum robots. However, this can easily be obscured, especially to a newcomer to the field, by the different applications, coordinate frame choices, and analytical formalisms employed. In this paper we review several modeling approaches in a common frame and notational convention, illustrating that for piecewise constant curvature, they produce identical results. This discussion elucidates what has been articulated in different ways by a number of researchers in the past several years, namely that constant-curvature kinematics can be considered as consisting of two separate submappings: one that is general and applies to all continuum robots, and another that is robot-specific. These mappings are then developed both for the single-section and for the multi-section case. Similarly, we discuss the decomposition of differential kinematics (the robot's Jacobian) into robot-specific and robot-independent portions. The paper concludes with a perspective on several of the themes of current research that are shaping the future of continuum robotics.},
