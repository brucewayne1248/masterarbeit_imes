abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 by ASME.In this paper, we introduce a new type of spatial parallel robot that is comprised of soft inflatable constraints called trichamber actuators (TCAs). We extend the principles of the freedom and constraint topologies (FACT) synthesis approach to enable the synthesis and analysis of this new type of soft robot. The concepts of passive and active freedom spaces are introduced and applied to the design of general parallel systems that consist of active constraints (i.e., constraint that can be actuated to impart various loads onto the system's stage) that both drive desired motions and guide the system's desired degrees of freedom (DOFs). We provide the fabrication details of the TCA constraints introduced in this paper and experimentally determine their appropriate FACT-based constraint model. We fabricate a soft parallel robot that consists of three TCA constraints and verify and validate its FACT-predicted performance using finite element analysis (FEA) and experimental data. Other such soft robots are synthesized using FACT as case studies},

abstract = {In this letter, we present the design, kinematic analysis, model validation, and teleoperation of a miniature eight-degree-of-freedom (8-DOF) parallel continuum manipulator with a cable-driven grasper. Our motivation is to provide increased dexterity and stability in confined-space surgical applications, particularly for intraluminal endoscopic procedures. The system design uses six superelastic NiTi (Nitinol) tubes in a standard Stewart-Gough configuration and an integrated end effector that provides 180° articulation of two jaws actuated by Kevlar cables that pass through the tube legs. A computationally efficient inverse kinematics model provides real-time, low-level actuator commands to enable teleoperation. We provide a kinematic workspace analysis of this design, which depicts how mechanical strain, dexterity, and the effect of force application vary over the reachable workspace. We also experimentally characterize the open-loop model accuracy and repeatability of our physical prototype, obtaining mean errors of approximately 1.19 mm and 3.81° and a repeatability RMS error of 0.88 mm and 1.96°. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of minimally invasive surgical applications by conducting user trials for a pick-and-place task under unilateral model-based teleoperation.},

abstract = {Classic theories in nonlinear elasticity have increasingly been used to obtain accurate and efficient models for continuum robots and other elastic structures. Numerically computed solutions of these models typically satisfy the first-order conditions necessary for equilibrium, but do not provide any information about the elastic stability of the solution. The inability to detect or avoid physically unstable model solutions poses a major hindrance to reliable model-based simulation, planning, design, and control. In this paper, we adapt results from optimal control to determine the stability of Kirchhoff rods and Cosserat rods subject to general end constraints, including coupled multirod models which describe parallel continuum robots. We formulate a sufficient condition for the stability of a solution, a numerical test for evaluating this condition, and a heuristic stability metric. We verify that our numerical stability test agrees with the classical results for the buckling of single columns with various end constraints and for multicolumn frames. We then validate our approach experimentally on a six degree-of-freedom parallel continuum robot.},

abstract = {Parallel continuum robots have the potential to provide multi-degree-of-freedom articulation using a structure that is simple, compact, compliant, and highly scalable. These characteristics may be useful in micromanipulation, endoscopic robotic-assisted surgery, and human-robot interaction. Our prior work formulated a kinematic model which treats a parallel continuum robot as a set of multiple Cosserat rods with coupled boundary conditions. In this paper, we detail methods for the efficient numerical solution of this model at rates that enable real-time interactive simulation, motion planning, design optimization, and control. Exploitation of the model structure enables a significant reduction in the number of integrations required to evaluate the boundary value Jacobian matrix used in a shooting method. Our approach is used to teleoperate a prototype robot using real-time inverse kinematics solutions, and simulation tests show that inverse kinematics solutions are consistently computed at rates of several kilohertz using standard desktop computing hardware.},

abstract = {— Parallel continuum robots consist of a parallel arrangement of flexible legs and are dexterous, compliant, and easily miniaturized for minimally invasive surgery. By design, parallel continuum robots exhibit large, nonlinear deformations in their legs to achieve multi-DOF end effector articulation, but excess leg bowing can limit their reachable workspace, especially for long slender designs. In this paper, we investi-gate a parallel continuum robot design with a passive spring backbone carrying disks that constrain the legs at interme-diate points. The constraints route the legs in helical paths around the backbone and prevent large divergence of the legs, expanding the reachable workspace for slender form factors while preserving the manipulator's six degrees of freedom. We present a novel forward and inverse kinematics model, based on Cosserat rod theory, that accommodates general leg routing paths and any number of intermediate constraint disks. We also explore manipulator workspace with experiments and simulations, demonstrating that intermediate constraints expand the reachable workspace of slender parallel continuum robots.},

abstract = {We propose a new class of robotic device for minimally-invasive surgery that lies at the intersection of continuum, parallel, and reconfigurable robotics. This Continuum Reconfigurable Incisionless Surgical Parallel (CRISP) paradigm involves the use of multiple needle-diameter devices inserted through the skin and assembled into parallel structures inside the body. The parallel structure can be reconfigured inside the patient's body to satisfy changing task requirements such as reaching initially inaccessible locations or modifying mechanical stiffness for manipulation or palpation. Another potential advantage of the CRISP concept is that many small (needle-sized) entry points into the patient may be preferable in terms of both patient healing and cosmesis to the single (or multiple) larger ports needed to admit current surgical robots. This paper presents a mechanics-based model for CRISP forward and inverse kinematics, along with experimental validation.},
